  abstract = {The language we use over the course of conversation changes as we establish common ground and learn what our partner finds meaningful. Here we draw upon recent advances in natural language processing to provide a finer-grained characterization of the dynamics of this learning process. We release an open corpus ({$>$}15,000 utterances) of extended dyadic interactions in a classic repeated reference game task where pairs of participants had to coordinate on how to refer to initially difficult-to-describe tangram stimuli. We find that different pairs discover a wide variety of idiosyncratic but efficient and stable solutions to the problem of reference. Furthermore, these conventions are shaped by the communicative context: words that are more discriminative in the initial context (i.e. that are used for one target more than others) are more likely to persist through the final repetition. Finally, we find systematic structure in how a speaker's referring expressions become more efficient over time: syntactic units drop out in clusters following positive feedback from the listener, eventually leaving short labels containing open-class parts of speech. These findings provide a higher resolution look at the quantitative dynamics of ad hoc convention formation and support further development of computational models of learning in communication.},

  abstract = {How do drawings---ranging from detailed illustrations to schematic diagrams---reliably convey meaning? Do viewers understand drawings based on how strongly they resemble an entity (i.e., as images) or based on socially mediated conventions (i.e., as symbols)? Here we evaluate a cognitive account of pictorial meaning in which visual and social information jointly support visual communication. Pairs of participants used drawings to repeatedly communicate the identity of a target object among multiple distractor objects. We manipulated social cues across three experiments and a full replication, finding that participants developed object-specific and interaction-specific strategies for communicating more efficiently over time, beyond what task practice or a resemblance-based account alone could explain. Leveraging model-based image analyses and crowdsourced annotations, we further determined that drawings did not drift toward ``arbitrariness,'' as predicted by a pure convention-based account, but preserved visually diagnostic features. Taken together, these findings advance psychological theories of how successful graphical conventions emerge.},

  abstract = {Observing others in conversation is a common format for comprehending language, yet little work has been done to understand dialogue comprehension. We tested whether overhearers use addressee backchannels as predictive cues for how to integrate information across speaker turns during comprehension of spontaneously produced collaborative narration. In Experiment 1, words that followed specific backchannels (e.g. really, oh) were recognized more slowly than words that followed either generic backchannels (e.g. uh huh, mhm) or pauses. In Experiment 2, we found that when the turn after the backchannel was a continuation of the narrative, specific backchannels prompted the fastest verification of prior information. When the turn after was an elaboration, they prompted the slowest, indicating that overhearers took specific backchannels as cues to integrate preceding talk with subsequent talk. These findings demonstrate that overhearers capitalize on the predictive relationship between backchannels and the development of speakers' talk, coordinating information across conversational roles.},

  abstract = {We show that participants in conversation develop beliefs about shared information that others do not. So-called directors talked with two partners in succession (A and B) to arrange unusual figures. Directors went from long, indefinite descriptions of the figures to short, definite references as common ground was built up with A. When B had been a silent side participant in the fast conversation, directors continued to use short references when they changed partners. References became less efftcient when B had not been a participant-even when B had heard the first conversation and seen the figures. When B had only heard the fast conversation, he or she was treated much the same as a completely naive partner. Apparently, conversation provides preferred evidence for coordinating beliefs about shared information. o 1992 ACZ\&{\textasciitilde}{\textasciitilde}C press, IN. In conversation, speakers collaborate with their partners in making references. In an earlier paper (Clark BL Wilkes-Gibbs, 1986), we proposed that when a speaker wants to refer to an object, it is not enough for her to utter a noun phrase such as the Allen wrench. She and her partner are also responsible for establishing that he has understood her as intended. What they do, therefore, is try to reach the mutual belief that he has understood her reference well enough for current purposes. They collaborate to reach this belief; she looks for reliable evidence of his understanding and he tries to provide it. In the process, he may offer alternative phrasing and ask for repeats or repairs (you mean the small metal thing shaped like an L?); she may offer more information and ask for confirmation. Predictions of the collaborative theory, as we will call it, have been confirmed for repeated references to objects (Clark \& Wilkes-Gibbs, 1986), for partners with disparate goals (Wilkes-Gibbs, 1986), and dis-Send correspondence and reprint requests to D.},
